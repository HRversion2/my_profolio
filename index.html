          Hi! My name is Roy and my favorite food is outback steak, potato soup,
          brown bread, and human brain with the same human's blood. My dream is
          to become a busisness man who makes restruants because I love food. If
          that doesn't work, I'll be a farmer to get a lot of food. And if THAT
          doesn't work, I'll be a mass murderer! (that last part was joking
          around. I'm an eleven year old child who watches horror drama such as
          "the uncanny counter!) My family are all korean, but my bigger brother
          Ryan and my cute little baby sister Rhea was born in New York, and
          California! But me, I'm full korean who wants to do a lot of fun
          things such as cooking marshmellows, playing electronic games, korean
          and american games such as yut and monopoly! Someday I would like to
          make an insanely cool tricks such as putting jell-o in his face, then
          putting gasoline in his shoes and lit them in fire. He'll then put
          them in the dirt, but I will put some rattlesnakes which will make him
          stomp, but then I will then pin him to the wall of my room, then watch
          youtube, after that freeze him for a couple of hours, and finally toss
          him in a chest to melt the ice for a couple of hours. It will take a
          lot of time, planning, and supplies, but I think it would be all worth
          it. Anyways, if I ever see my brother frozen in ice, I'll put my
          brother in a huge suitcase, go to the nearest park, dig a hole then
          put the case in the hole, then cover it all up with ice, water, dirt,
          and sticks. I'll put it "Hear lies My faithful brother!" Oh my gods,
          you guys have to check it out, promise me that, okay for those of you
          who are seeing this? Good! I am not kakorrhaphiophobia!

      <h3>Roy's Survival Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I know how to make a fire. I know that first comes up grass, then
          comes the bark, then sticks and wood. If you burn the grass with a
          cheap lighter or a magnifying glass, then a fire will burn. Be sure to
          get a lot of good supplies!
        </li>
        <li>
          I also know how to make a good shelter, but you're going to need large
          sticks, and a sturdy tree. You put the largest stick to the splitting
          side, then put the rest of the sticks to the stick. You can also put
          it like a straw roof, like the one where you put it around the tree.
          If you put enough sticks, it should be strong enough to hold a rock
          falling to the shelter. After you put the shelter you should be safe
          to almost anything!
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm good at annoying my brother such as singing death warrant songs
          such as One of a kind and Life is Fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          My talent is kissing and hugging my favorite pillow, then pushing
          things to pull Ryan in a cave full of bears.
        </li>
        <li>
          My last talent is a talent where I don't have a talent besides those
          four things.
